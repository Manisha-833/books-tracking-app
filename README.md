# books-tracking-app
Create a simple book tracking app that allows users to see a collection of books with the following
specifications:
Fetch the book collection - can be a static local json or mocked within the code.
Note: The fetch structure should be implemented even if mocked.
Display the list of books with image, title, author and genre.
Give the user the option to switch between grid view and list view.
When a user clicks on a book card / list item a modal will be opened and book description,
image, title and author will be displayed
Add a light/dark mode toggle and style the app accordingly.
Allow the user to filter the books by adding a search bar. The user should be able to filter all
the fields and the list should be updated.
The app should be responsive
